# Distributed Algorithms Visualizer

An interactive playground to test how various distributed algorithms behave under different conditions (e.g. network partitions or node failures).

## Develop

To run the project in dev mode

```
yarn start
```

To build the website

```
yarn build
```

## Contributing

If you want to add a new algorithm to the available visualizations create a new file in the `src/algorithms` folder, it should follow the same structure as the other file in that folder. Once you have tested it locally open a pull request.
